## Design Principles Applied

### BEM Methodology

- **Block**: `.shops`, `.shop-detail`
- **Element**: `.shops__header`, `.shops__card`, `.shop-detail__inventory`
- **Modifier**: `.shops__badge--weapons`, `.shops__empty-button--secondary`

### CSS Variables Usage

- Consistent color theming using CSS custom properties
- Dark/light theme support
- Semantic color naming (primary, secondary, danger, success, etc.)
- Responsive spacing and sizing

### TypeScript Best Practices

- Proper type imports from domain types
- Type-safe prop handling
- Elimination of `any` types
- Optional chaining for safety

### Accessibility Features

- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management
- Reduced motion support
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Semantic HTML structure

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible grid layouts
- Touch-friendly interactive elements
- Adaptive typography and spacing

## Integration Points

### Data Flow

- Uses `useCampaigns` hook for data access
- Integrates with existing campaign, NPC, location, and item data
- Maintains consistency with existing data patterns

### Navigation

- React Router integration
- Programmatic navigation with `useNavigate`
- Consistent routing patterns with other pages

### UI Consistency

- Matches existing page structure patterns
- Uses same loading and error state patterns
- Consistent button and form styling
- Same iconography patterns (React Icons)
